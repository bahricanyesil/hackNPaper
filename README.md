HackNPaper Project - Data Structures&Algorithms

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

Heraclitus once said “The only constant in life is change”. Heraclitus was a wise man, indeed, but he missed an exception: if you take CMPE 250, you solve a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) project!
Well, but what is DES?
Enter, Wikipedia: “A discrete-event simulation (DES) models the operation of a system as a (discrete) sequence of events in time. Each event occurs at a particular instant in time and marks a change of state in the system. Between consecutive events, no change in the system is assumed to occur; thus the simulation time can directly jump to the occurrence time of the next event”. In other words, DES is the representation of a certain process by simulating certain events which occur at certain times. Hence, time is not continuous in DES and progress according to the events.

In this project, you are expected to simulate HackNPaper, which is a hackathon organized by Dunder Miﬄin, Scranton.
